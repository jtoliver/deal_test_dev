1.	Profiled with miniprofiler gem
At start
	Deals index took an average of 1241ms to load
	The sql query took an average of 75ms
	
At end
	I cached the deals index page and added pagination
	Not it takes an average of 85ms to load the deals index page before caching
	and it take an average of 12.8ms for the page to load after the page has been cached.
	Seems like a mixture of caching and pagination made the page load faster and made the page
	a little more stable. In production compiling the assets could also take a little time off.
